SQL Views

Views in SQL are kind of virtual tables. A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.

Creating a view means defining it in terms of its base tables. The definition of the view is stored in the system catalogs without any data. When you query or perform data modification commands through the view, you are accessing the data that is stored in

association with the underlying tables. In other words, creating a view does not generate a copy of the data, neither at the time the view is defined nor at the time the view is accessed.

When you query a view, it looks exactly like any other database table. You can display it in much the same way as you can any other table, with few restrictions.

A view is nothing more than a SQL statement that is stored in the database with an associated name. A view is actually a composition of a table in the form of a predefined SQL query.

A view can contain all rows of a table or select rows from a table. A view can be created from one or many tables which depends on the written SQL query to create a view.

Views, which are a type of virtual tables allow users to do the following âˆ’

Structure data in a way that users or classes of users find natural or intuitive.

Restrict access to the data in such a way that a user can see and (sometimes) modify exactly what they need and no more.

Summarize data from various tables which can be used to generate reports.
